# in-order  to use this repository you need to set up the env variables to connect to redis client

You can either do that by using the cloud service or local.

## Run the application and open up postman and go to [server url](http://localhost:5000) to make a request and look at your console to see results. Try make as many request as possible to see the magic

The request body should look like this :

    {
    "dish":"Beans ðŸ¥—",
    "qty":"20"
    }

Happy Coding
